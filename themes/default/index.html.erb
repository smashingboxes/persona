                <h3>A Tool for Prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                    Prototypical is a lightweight prototyping tool built on <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra</a> with the goal of assisting developers with the rapid creation of working prototypes.
                    Prototypical is responsive, easy to set up, and takes most of the grunt work out of building an initial draft to show clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some things developers should never have to worry about when making prototypes. Here's what I've created:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A Toolkit</strong> including a <a href="/tools/sitemap">Sitemap</a> and a clean, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">responsive</a> stylesheet (View it <a href="/tools/type">here</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Content management</strong> which gives clients control over content/layout without breaking anything (let them try, I <em>dare</em> them).</li>
                        <li><strong>A strong frontend</strong> powered by <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank>">Compass</a> (an extension of <a href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_blank">Sass</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Easy deployment</strong>, straight to <a href="http://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h4>More Under the Hood</h4>
                <p>
                   At the present, Prototypical uses <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt/" target="_blank">Tilt</a> to support templating, with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> to allow clients/designers to safely edit the content on pages. 
                   Creating templates is as easy as dropping files into the <code>templates</code> folder, and includes built-in support commands similar to that of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> such as:
                    <br/><br/>
                    <code>
                          get_header <br/>  
                          the_title <br/>
                          the_content <br/>
                          get_footer
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Plus it's built on Ruby, which is awesome in and of itself.</p>
