Prototypical is a lightweight prototyping tool built on Sinatra with the goal of assisting developers with the rapid creation of working prototypes. Prototypical is responsive, easy to set up, and takes most of the grunt work out of building an initial draft to show clients.

There are some things developers should never have to worry about when making prototypes. Here's what I've created:

*A Toolkit including a Sitemap and a clean, responsive stylesheet (View it here)
*Content management which gives clients control over content/layout without breaking anything (let them try, I dare them).
*A strong frontend powered by CoffeeScript and Compass (an extension of Sass)
*Easy deployment, straight to Heroku
*More Under the Hood

At the present, Prototypical uses Tilt to support templating, with Markdown to allow clients/designers to safely edit the content on pages. Creating templates is as easy as dropping files into the templates folder, and built-in support commands similar to that of WordPress including: 

`get_header `
`the_title`
`the_content`
`get_footer`

Plus it's built on Ruby, which is awesome in and of itself.
